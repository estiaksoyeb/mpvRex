/**
 * One source of truth for expressive press feedback.
 *
 * Before this existed the same gesture shipped at four magnitudes (0.97, 0.98, 0.90, 0.85), each
 * with its own spring, re-implemented file by file. Components should reach for
 * [pressScale] / [pressShape] instead of reading an [InteractionSource] themselves, so a change
 * to the feel lands everywhere at once.
 *
 * Two behaviours are kept separate, because they answer different questions:
 *  - [pressScale]: the transient "pushed in" scale for tappable surfaces.
 *  - [pressShape]: the resting -> pressed shape morph, for controls that change silhouette.
 *
 * Do not add navigation, loading or header motion here. Those are load-bearing for the jank fix
 * documented in `docs/ui-design/NAV_MOTION.md` and are owned by [RexMotion].
